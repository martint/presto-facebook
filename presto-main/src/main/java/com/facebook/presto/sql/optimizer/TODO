- Memo is an "environment", with variable bindings. The top-level has no bindings
   - A lambda results in an environment with a binding of its variable
   - We can create a sub-memo for each lambda, parameterized by their bindings


(filter
    (\x (+ x (enforce-scalar (get 'u'))))
    (get 'u'))



memo ()
   $0 = (get 'u')
   $1 = (filter $4 $0)


memo (x)
   $2 = (get 'u')           <<< is this the same as $0?
   $3 = (enforce-scalar $2)
   $4 = (call '+' x $3)
